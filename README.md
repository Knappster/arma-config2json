# arma-config2json
Arma rapified config parser to JSON (https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/raP_File_Format_-_Elite).

This has been primarily been built to read profile variables from Arma 3 '.vars.Arma3Profile' files with the intent to read data from Antistasi game saves (https://github.com/official-antistasi-community/A3-Antistasi).

Inspired by SwiftMissionDeRap (https://github.com/headswe/SwiftMissionDeRap).
